The majority of the data records are of proteins. With DNA being the precursor to RNA, which when translated, proteins are the biomolecules that are directly interacting in biological pathways and cycles. Proteins are usually centered around one or a few job which is defined by their family type. For example, we can have a protein that is from a Hydrolase group, which focuses on catalyzing hydrolysis (breaking bonds by adding water) in order to help promote destruction of chains of proteins, or other molecules. Another example would be a protein that is a transport protein, which allows other molecules such as sucrose, fructose, or even water come in and outside of the cell. \n\n## Goals\nWith these proteins having different family types, a question arises if it's possible to determine a protein's family type based on sequence. There are notable search engines such as BLAST which has this capability, but it'd be interesting to see if a machine learning approach can do a good job in classifying a protein's family based on the protein sequence.\n\n### 1). Import Dataset\nTo begin, the libraries and datasets are loaded. Since the sequence is of a type string, this appears to be a good opporunity to try using a CountVectorizer -- a feature extractor that is usually used with NLP machine learning models.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 1). ----- Import Libraries and Datasets ------\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\n\n\n# Import Datasets\ndf_seq = pd.read_csv('../input/pdb_data_seq.csv')\ndf_char = pd.read_csv('../input/pdb_data_no_dups.csv')\n\nprint('Datasets have been loaded...')","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Filter and Process Data\nWith the data loaded into two seperate pandas dataframes, a filter, project, and a join must be performed to get the data together.

Train Test Split\nAfter finally filtering the dataset, a split on the data to create a training and testing set must be performed. After splitting the data, it's important to utilize the CountVectorizer to create a dictionary composed from the training dataset. This will extract individual characters or subsets of characters to gain features. An important note about using the CountVectorizer is the specification of the ngram_range. \n\nIn a protein, it's not the individual amino acid in the protein that gives identification to what it's purpose is. There are secondary and tertiary structures that are formed via the bonds of the amino acids in the sequence. Furthermore, different parts of the chain can be more basic, and others can be more acidic, indicating it's important to use features that are larger than just one unit. As a result, using an ngram_range of (4,4) seems to be a legitmate choice for feature extraction. This will extract different subsets that are of length 4 allowing the amino acids to use their neighbors to aid in our classification.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d345b884-63a8-47dc-b576-136463d6e174","_uuid":"500a215db824e919b28527862ae5b4e245d6d04b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 3). ----- Train Test Split -----\n\n# Split Data\nX_train, X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(data['sequence'], data['classification'], test_size = 0.2, random_state = 1)\n\n# Create a Count Vectorizer to gather the unique elements in sequence\nvect = CountVectorizer(analyzer = 'char_wb', ngram_range = (4,4))\n\n# Fit and Transform CountVectorizer\nvect.fit(X_train)\nX_train_df = vect.transform(X_train)\nX_test_df = vect.transform(X_test)\n\n#Print a few of the features\nprint(vect.get_feature_names()[-20:])","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"40ce99f2-f588-4cf1-8881-7a3b7a611e47","_uuid":"114ea850cc1601b8ff6b8572a82ab3400c0ec1a3","trusted":true},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4).

A lof of proteins tend to share very similar characteristics, as some proteins are meant to bind in similar regions as others. For example, a Hydrolase enzyme and a Hydrolase inhibitor protein are going to have similar structures as they will target very similar areas. This is reflected in the confusion matrix and heat map. Gene regulator proteins will have a similarity to RNA binding proteins, DNA binding proteins, as well as transcription proteins.  The biggest thing to note as well, as the model only uses features of 4 amino acids at most. The possibility of utilizing amino acids of higher degree in theory should be able to create an even higher accuracy.\n\n### Future Work\nThere is definitely room for improvement for the model. Utilizing factors such as pH, molecular weight, and other components may be able to yield more information on family group. Furthermore, if possible, increase the length of the ngram_range to include more than just 4 characters to allow for higher interaction between the amino acids as reflected in reality\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"6f4674cfbd1a43d656474a3862fe05b3569a8be5"}}]}
